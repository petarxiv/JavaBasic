Wrapper classes:
They are object types for all the primitive types. When we use the wrapper classes we get all
the benefits of classes and objects for example we can have methods.
also, generics works with only classes
<> diamond operator we specify the data type
boxing happens when we convert a primitive to corresponding wrapper type
int num=10;
Integer num2=new Integer(num) //boxing
unboxing happens when we convert a wrapper object to a corresponding primitive type
Integer num2=new Integer(10)
int num=num2.intValue();

Integer num=10; //autoBoxing
int num2=num; //auto unboxing
List(it is an interface in collections frame which is implemented by tow classes
ArrayList LinkedList
)
1) we can store the duplicate values in lists
2) insertion order is maintained.
When to use ArrayList:
if most of the operations are reading and storing new data and not shifting
or changing the position of data then we should go with array list.
When to use LinkedList:
when most of the operations are related to changing the position of data
or related to data shifting then we should go with linkedList
