Method Overriding in Java
Method overriding happens when we have same name methods in parent anf child class
classes.
Benefits
1) Flexibility if we don't like something from the parent class we can override it and
can provide our own implementation
2) Same method can act differently depending upon the object on which we call it.
Rules:
1) without inheritance method overriding is not possible
2) Method signature should be same in parent class and in child class
3) If something does not participate in inheritance we can override it like
constructors and private methods
4) We can increase the visibility in the child classes but we can't decrease it
for example we can go from default or protected to public, we can't do the reverse.
5) We can't override a static method, but we can redeclare it. For example main
method can't be overridden as it is static
6)We can't have different return type in the child class it musr be same as the
class
