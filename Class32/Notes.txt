FileHandling in Java
Reading and writing data to files is called file handling.
Things that we need to read/write data to files
1) File path, location of our file on our computer
2) Navigate to that location we use FileInputStream if we are reading and FileOutputStream
if we are writing the data
3) A specific class that knows how to read/write data to a specific class for example for
.properties files we use Properties and for Excel files we use XSSFworkbook classes
