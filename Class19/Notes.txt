Access Modifiers in Java:
Access modifiers allow us to control the visibility of class members (fields, methods,
constructors etc.) and classes itself in Java
There are 4 access levels and there are 3 keywords that we use to define these
access level fourth level is applier when we dont use any access modifier keyword
levels from most restricted to less restricted are:
1)private(keyword is also private)
2)default(no keyword means default access level)
3)protected(keyword is also protected)
4)public(keyword is also public)
Rules:
1)We should always prefer private access modifier for the fields. Because fields contain the data and the
methods of you class might use that data to perform some tasks if we don't perform sanity
checks before setting the values to these fields our classes and methods might
misbehave also the access of the data should be restricted so that not every one can access
the data.
2) we can't use access modifiers with local variables

Constructors
Constructors in java allows us ti set the values of the fields of a
class.
