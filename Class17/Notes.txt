Types of variables:
There are 3 types of variables local, instance and static

class Vars{
int age=10; //instance variable
static double weight=25.5; //static

void method(){
String name="Moreed"; //local variable
}
}

local variables:
if a variable is defined inside a method or loop or switch or any other block
of code it is called local variable.
Instance variables:
if a variable is not declared inside a method but it is inside a class then
it is called an instance variable
Static variable:
if a variable is not declared inside a method but it is inside a class and
it has static keyword with it then
it is called a static variable
When to use which type of variable:
Local variables:
Local variables should always be preferred over instance and static variables that's why because they occupy the computers memory for very, very short amount of time
as soon as their purpose is served Java destroys them.
Pros:
save memory
cons:
not accessible outside of methods/block of code
Instance Variables:
when we want to share something in multiple methods of a class and the information is
expected to be different from object to object we should go with instance variables
Pros:
accessible in all the methods of a class
Cons:
occupy the computers' memory for longer than local variables

Static variables:
when we know that information will stay same for all the objects of a class we should create
a static variable for that
Pros:
single memory location for all objects of a class
Cons:
stay longer in the memory
can hold only one value at a time
