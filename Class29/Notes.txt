Set in java:
Set is an interface in collections framework which is implemented by many classes for example
HashSet, LinkedHashSet and TreeHashSet.
Properties of Set:
All the Sets don't allow duplicates
HashSet:
1) HasSet does not maintain the insertion order
2) is it the fastest in all Sets
LinkedHasSet:
1) Maintains the insertion order
2) slower than HashSet but faster than TreeSet specially the insertions
ThreeSet:
1) Sorts the data in the natural order. For number in increasing order
2) is it slowest when it comes to store the data
When to use which type of Set
1)If we don't care about insertion order and data being sorted always use Hashset
2)if we need the insertion order we (Batch 12) don't have much choice
we have to use the linkedHashset but if we don't care about the insertion order
we can compare it with TreeSet
LinkedHashSet       vs          TreeHashset
Insertion is now slow           Slowest insertion
Retrieval is super slow         slower than HashSet but faster than linkedHashSet
I don't care about insertion order but, I care about retrieval speed which Set should I use?
LinkedHashSet
if I want to have sorted data all the time?
TreeSet
