Abstraction in Java:
Hiding the implementation and providing the functionality
Two Methods to achieve abstractions:
1) Abstract classes
2) Interfaces
Abstract classes:
Abstract classes are classes with abstract keyword.
Interfaces:
Interfaces are the contracts that we create with the help of interface keyword
How to decide which one to use:
1) Prefer the interfaces over abstract classes
2) if tow or more classes are closely related to each other go with
abstract classes for example if we have to create a Lion class and a horse class
if two classes are not related to each to other for example an Apple and a Cloth
we should create an interface for that like if we want to have a behavior washAble.
Encapsulation
it is the fourth pillar of OOPS. it provides security and better control over the data
of a class.
we create classes and inside those classes we create private fields and methods.
these methods are classes getter setter methods and we set and get the values of the
class fields with the help of these methods instead of accessing and modifing  them
directly
