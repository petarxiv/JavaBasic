Types of variables:
There are three types of variables local, instance and static
Local variables:
The variables that are declared inside a method or block of code are called local variables.
Pros:
Save memory
Cons:
limited access can not be accessed outside of methods or block of code where they are declared
Instance variables:
The variables which are declared inside a class but outside of a method or block of code are called instance variables
Pros:
instance variables are accessible in all the methods of that class
Cons:
They occupy the computers memory for longer as compared to local variables
Static variables:
if instance variables have static keyword with them, they are called static variables
Pros:
Single memory location for all the objects of that class.
Cons:
Can hold only one value for all the objects and stays even longer inside the memory than instance variables
-----------------
Access modifiers:
Access modifiers are keywords in java that defines from where a certain variable,
method or a class etc. can be accessed
There are 4 types of access in java that we can define using three keywords
1) private 2) protected 3) public
Types of access are 4
1) private 2) default(applied when no keywords is used) 3) procted 4) public
private access(keyword is private):
when we use the private keyword with any of the variables, methods or classes these
can only be accessed within that class
default access(applied when we don't use any keywords)
When we don't use any of the keywords default access is applied by java to
those variables methods or classes etc. which means these things can only be accessed
from the same package

procted access(we use the protected class)
when protected access is applied class members(variables methods etc.) can be accessed from other
packages but only in the classes that participate in inheritance

public access(public keywords):
public means class members and classes can be accessed from anywhere inside that project
