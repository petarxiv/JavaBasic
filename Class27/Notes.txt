Collections FrameWork in Java:
collection of classes that help us manage and manipulate data in a better way.
ArraysList
1)This class has many built=in methods like add() remove() clear() etc.
2)Dynamic and can adjust their size at run time.

ArrayList<String> arrayList=new ArrayList<>();
ArrayList>name of the class
<> => diamond operator we specify the data type
Wrapper classes
byte=Byte
short=>Short
int=>integer
double=>Double
char=>Character

why wrapper classes
1)we get built=in methods
2)a lot of frameworks don't support primitives
when to use primitive:
1)when we care about the memory because primitives occupy 4 times less memory as compared to
wrapper
2)performance
when to use Wrapper
when we can about our ease.
