Constructors in Java:
Constructors in Java are special block of code similar to methods that initialize the
objects of a class
Rules:
1)They don't have return type not even void
2)Name of the constructor must be same as name of the class
3) Constructors cannot have non access modifiers like static final etc.
4) We can use the access modifiers like public private protected with constructors
5)if we don't write a constructor in a class a default constructor is provided by compiler
6)We can have multiple constructors in a class but their number of arguments sequence of argument
ot type of argument should be different.
7)if we have multiple constructors then Java decide which constructor to call based on the parameters we pass.
This keyword:
its a reserved keyword in java that we can use to refer to instance variables methods or constructors of a class
1) "this" keyword is used to distinguish instance variables with local variables
2) We can use "this" keyword to call the constructor of a class inside another constructors
3)we can use the "this" keyword to call the methods of a class
Rules:
1) this() should be the first line inside of constructor
2) this() can't be used inside methods.
