Abstract classes in Java
Abstract classes in java are the classes with abstract keyword. We use abstract classes
to achieve abstraction
Abstraction:
Is the process of hiding implementation details and only showing the functionality of
the end user
Benefits:
1)reduces the complexity.
2)improves the maintainability
3)Can also enforce rules utp to a certain limit
Disadvantages:
1)classes get tightly coupled


class Dog{
String name;
//concrete class
}
public abstract class Phone
String make;
String model;
static boolean has5G=4;
}
Abstract classes can have all the things that regular classes do, but we can't create
their objects direcyly and if a class is inheriting from the abstract class it must either
provide the implementation for the abstract method or it must be declared abstract
1) we can't have final and abstract keyword with a method at the same time.
2) we can't have static and abstract keywords with a method at the same time
3)Abstract keyword with fields not allowed
Interfaces:
Interfaces are also used to achieve abstraction in Java
we can create an interface with the keyword interface.

interface Human{
public static void int legs=2;
public abstract void walk();
public void eat(){

}
}
