Maps in java:
Map is an interface that allows us to store the data in key value pairs
Benefits:
1) we can store values inside the maps
2) Searching is very efficient in maps
Types of maps:
1) HashMap
2) LinkedHashMap
3)TreeMap

HashMap:
1) Insertion order is not maintained (downside)
2) Insertion and retrieval is fastest(upside)
LinkedHashMap:
1) insertion order is maintained (upside)
2) insertion speed is same as Hashmap but retrieval speed is slowest
TreeMap:
1) Data is sorted in natural order by default
2) insertion speed is slowest but retrieval speed is better than linkedHashMap but slower
than HashMap
Rules:
1) We can't convert a collection to a map for example we can't convert a set to a Map
2) Duplicate keys are not allowed in maps
3) Duplicate values are allowed

Map<String, String> students=new Map<>()
students.put("Yaz123","Yazgul");
Set<String>set=new HashSet(students)
