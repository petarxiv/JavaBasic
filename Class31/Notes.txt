Maps in Java:
It's a data structure that allows us to store key value pairs.
1)Searching is efficient
2)We cna use any types of keys like Double, String, Char, etc. we are not restricted to int
based natural indesex.

Retrieval:
means getting back the data from a data strucrite
There are many times of maps but, we will be discussing only four of them
1)HashMap
2) LinkedHashMap
3)ThreeMap
4)HashTable(old)

HashMap:
1) HashMap is the fastest one when it comes to inserting and retrieving the data.
2)insertion order is not maintained.
3)Most widely used map

LinkedHashMap:
1)LinkedHashMap maintains the insertion order
2)Insertion speed is same as HashMap
3)Retrieval is the slowest one

ThreeMap:
1)Data is sorted based on the natural order
2)Insertion is slowest because of the sorting

HashTable:
Is a thread safe means it can handle multiple insertions and retrivals at the same
time from multiple CPU cores but because of thread safety features it is also
very slow so if            never write multithreading code never
use it
